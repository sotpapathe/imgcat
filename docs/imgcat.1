\f[B]imgcat\f[] \- cat, but for images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]imgcat\f[] \f[B][options]\f[] \f[I]image\f[]
.PD 0

\f[B]imgcat\f[] \f[B][options]\f[] < \f[I]image\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]imgcat\f[] prints an image to your terminal screen.
.PP
The image can either be provided as a command line argument, or can be
piped in through \f[C]stdin\f[].
.PP
By default, the image is printed at the full width and color depth
detected for your terminal.
This can be overridden using \f[B]\-w\f[] to adjust the maximum width or
\f[B]\-R\f[] to prevent resizing, even if the image is too big to fit in
the terminal; and \f[B]\-d\f[] to explicitly set the color depth.
You may also use \f[B]\-r\f[] to adjust the height ("r" for "number of
rows").
If only one of \f[B]\-w\f[] or \f[B]\-r\f[] is provided, the image will
be scaled without affecting the aspect ratio, if possible.
.PP
Setting \f[B]\-H\f[] enables the use of half\-height block drawing
characters (as opposed to "full height" spaces used in the default
mode).
This effectively doubles the vertical resolution of the terminal, and
thus the image on your terminal will appear less "squished", and have a
greater pixel resolution.
Note that this effect works best on terminals that output using a
bitmapped font, and have a line height of exactly 100%
(example (https://git.io/vhW5F)).
Using anti\-aliased fonts may distort the blocks, and using a taller
line height will make the half\-height block cover \f[I]less\f[] than
half of the block, further distorting the image
(example (https://git.io/vhW5d)).
Your millage may vary.
.PP
If the output is not a terminal (that is, output is redirected to a
file, or piped into another program), then the image is \f[B]not\f[]
resized and the color depth is set to 8 colors.
Overriding both width, height, and color depth still work.
.PP
\f[B]Make sure your \f[C]TERM\f[] environment variable is set to a
terminfo with the full capabilities of you terminal!\f[] See
\f[B]Troubleshooting\f[] if you\[aq]re having a problem with this.
.SS Options

.B \f[B]\-d\f[] \f[I]MODE\f[], \f[B]\-\-depth\f[]=\f[I]MODE\f[]
Explicitly set the output color depth to one of \f[B]ansi\f[],
\f[B]8\f[] (alias of \f[B]ansi\f[]), \f[B]256\f[], \f[B]24bit\f[],
\f[B]true\f[] (alias of \f[B]24bit\f[]) or \f[B]iterm\f[].
If not provided, the output color depth will be inferred with
\f[C]tput\ colors\f[].

.B \f[B]\-H\f[], \f[B]\-\-half\-height\f[]
Prints half\-height blocks to double the vertical resolution, and make
for a less squished image.
Works best when each character cell is exactly twice as tall as it is
wide and when your terminal is using a bitmapped font.

.B \f[B]\-r\f[] \f[I]ROWS\f[], \f[B]\-\-height\f[]=\f[I]ROWS\f[]
Resizes the image to \f[I]ROWS\f[] characters high.
Does nothing if \f[B]\-\-no\-resize\f[] is provided.
Maintains the original image\[aq]s aspect ratio if \f[B]\-\-width\f[] is
NOT provided.

.B \f[B]\-R\f[], \f[B]\-\-no\-resize\f[]

Overrides both \f[B]\-\-width\f[] and \f[B]\-\-height\f[].

Shrink the image to \f[I]COLS\f[] characters wide.
Does nothing if \f[B]\-\-no\-resize\f[] is provided, or if the image is
already as small as the provided width.
Maintains the original image\[aq]s aspect ratio if \f[B]\-\-height\f[]
is NOT provided.

.SS iTerm2 3.0
.PP
\f[B]imgcat\f[] supports iTerm2\[aq]s full\-color inline images (use
\f[B]\-d iterm\f[] to explicitly enable this).
However, iTerm2 is bundled with a script that is also called
\f[B]imgcat\f[]! To use this program in preference to the script bundled
with iTerm2, edit your shell\[aq]s configuration file such that, after
the line that sources iTerm2\[aq]s shell integration and utilities, you
unalias its built\-in script:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
unalias\ imgcat
\f[]
.fi
.SS Troubleshooting
.PP
First, test how many colors your terminal can output:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ tput\ colors
256
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If this is not what you expect, you might want to change your
\f[C]TERM\f[] environment variable.
For example, iTerm2 users will probably want the following:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ export\ TERM=xterm\-256color
\f[]
.fi
.PP
However, it\[aq]s better that your terminal emulator reports itself with
the proper value for \f[C]TERM\f[].
For iTerm2, again, look under the current profile settings > Terminal >
Terminal Emulation > and change "Report Terminal Type".
